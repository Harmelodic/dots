- Add the following line to your interactive shell init script (i.e. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file):

```bash

## I'm just here to read, where do I start?

Look in the `bashrc` file in the project root. Everything gets `source`'d and built from there.

## Why `source-utils` and `utils`? Why not a single folder?

In bash, if you want to cleanly change directories and manipulate the file system, I found it's easier if you create functions in a file and then directly `source` that file, hence `source-utils`.

You'll also see that they are structured differently.  
Normal `utils` are just plain bash scripts, but `source-utils` look like:

```bash
cmd () {
    # Commands
}
```
